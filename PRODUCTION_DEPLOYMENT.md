# Production Deployment Guide

This guide covers the steps needed to deploy your FTP Data Visualizer app to production.

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Update `config/environment.ts` with production FTP settings
- [ ] Set appropriate refresh intervals for production use
- [ ] Configure file size limits and supported file types
- [ ] Enable/disable logging levels appropriately

### 2. Security Review
- [ ] Ensure FTP credentials are stored securely using `expo-secure-store`
- [ ] Review network security settings in `app.json`
- [ ] Validate input sanitization in FTP configuration
- [ ] Check that sensitive data is not logged in production

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Test app performance with large datasets
- [ ] Verify memory usage is within acceptable limits
- [ ] Ensure auto-refresh intervals are appropriate for production
- [ ] Test offline functionality and error recovery

### 4. Error Handling
- [ ] Verify all error scenarios are handled gracefully
- [ ] Test network failure recovery
- [ ] Ensure user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Validate logging and monitoring setup

## üì± Build Configuration

### Update app.json
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Your App Name",
    "slug": "your-app-slug",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "extra": {
      "eas": {
        "projectId": "your-actual-project-id"
      },
      "ftpHost": "your-production-ftp-host.com",
      "ftpPort": "21"
    }
  }
}
```

### Update eas.json
```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "autoIncrement": true,
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß Build Commands

### Development Build
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform all
```

### Preview Build
```bash
eas build --profile preview --platform all
```

### Production Build
```bash
eas build --profile production --platform all
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
The app includes built-in performance monitoring:
- FTP connection metrics
- File download/parsing performance
- Memory usage tracking
- Error logging and reporting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Connection success rate
- Average download time
- File parsing performance
- Memory usage patterns
- Error frequency and types

## üîí Security Considerations

### FTP Security
- Use FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) when possible
- Implement proper certificate validation
- Use strong authentication credentials
- Limit file access permissions on FTP server

### Data Protection
- Credentials are encrypted using device keychain/keystore
- Temporary files are cleaned up after processing
- No sensitive data is logged in production builds
- Network traffic uses secure protocols where possible

### App Security
- Input validation on all FTP configuration fields
- File size and type validation
- Secure storage of user preferences
- Protection against injection attacks

## üö® Error Recovery

### Automatic Recovery Features
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Graceful fallback to mock data
- Network state monitoring
- Automatic cleanup of failed operations

### Manual Recovery Options
- Connection test functionality
- Manual refresh capability
- Configuration reset options
- Clear cache/metrics functionality

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- Automatic cleanup of downloaded files
- Efficient data processing algorithms
- Memoized chart configurations
- Proper component lifecycle management

### Network Optimization
- Configurable retry attempts
- Connection timeout settings
- Bandwidth-aware refresh intervals
- Offline capability with cached data

## üîç Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] FTP connection with valid credentials
- [ ] FTP connection with invalid credentials
- [ ] File download and parsing
- [ ] Chart rendering with various data types
- [ ] Auto-refresh functionality
- [ ] Manual refresh capability
- [ ] Configuration save/load
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Large file processing (up to max size limit)
- [ ] Memory usage under load
- [ ] Network failure scenarios
- [ ] Background/foreground transitions
- [ ] Multiple rapid refresh attempts

### Security Testing
- [ ] Credential storage security
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Network security
- [ ] Data sanitization
- [ ] Error message information disclosure

## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare for Deployment
```bash
# Update version numbers
# Review and update configuration
# Run final tests
npm run lint
```

### 2. Build for Production
```bash
# iOS
eas build --profile production --platform ios

# Android
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

### 3. Submit to App Stores
```bash
# iOS App Store
eas submit --profile production --platform ios

# Google Play Store
eas submit --profile production --platform android
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment
- Check app store review status
- Monitor crash reports and analytics
- Verify production FTP connectivity
- Test with real production data

## üõ† Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Monitor performance metrics
- Review error logs
- Update dependencies
- Test with new data formats
- Backup configuration settings

### Update Process
1. Test changes in development
2. Build preview version
3. Test preview with stakeholders
4. Build production version
5. Submit to app stores
6. Monitor deployment

## üìû Support

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
1. **FTP Connection Failures**: Check network connectivity, credentials, and server status
2. **File Parsing Errors**: Verify file format and size limits
